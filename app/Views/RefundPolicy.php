Even then if for some reason you are not satisfied and think about going for a refund claim, it is our request that you take out a few precious minutes to write to us at contact@www.enatyam.org for a final dialogue prior to requesting a refund.</li>
                    <li>Only if we are unable to reach a common ground with you after talks should a refund claim be filed.</li>
